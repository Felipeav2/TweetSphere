## TweetSphere

### Overview

This is a personal projects I've decided to create. The purpose of this project is to create a Twitter-like social media app that allows users to post, comment and view other user's posts. The database that stores all the user info is managed in SQL, and the website is backed by CSRF protection. The front end uses a blend of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. The back end utilises python. In this app, users MUST be logged in in order to post, comment, or visualize posts.
